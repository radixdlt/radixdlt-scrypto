[![CI](https://github.com/radixdlt/radixdlt-scrypto/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/radixdlt/radixdlt-scrypto/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Language for building DeFi apps on Radix.

Documentation: https://docs.radixdlt.com/main/scrypto/introduction.html

## Installation

1. Install Rust - this requires Rust 1.60+ (if rust is already installed, upgrade with `rustup update`)
    * Windows:
        * Download and install [`rustup-init.exe`](https://win.rustup.rs/x86_64)
        * Install "Desktop development with C++" with [Build Tools for Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=BuildTools&rel=16)
        * Install [LLVM 13.0.1](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/download/llvmorg-13.0.1/LLVM-13.0.1-win64.exe) (make sure you tick the option that adds LLVM to the system PATH)
    *  macOS:
        * Make sure you have the xcode command line tools: `xcode-select --install`.
        * Install cmake: `brew install cmake`
        * Install the Rust compiler: 
        ```bash
            curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
        ```
    * Linux:
        * Make sure a C++ compiler and LLVM is installed (`sudo apt install build-essential llvm`).
        * Install the Rust compiler:
        ```bash
        curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
        ```
2. Enable `cargo` in the current shell:
   * Windows:
       * Start a new PowerShell
   * Linux and macOS:
       ```
       source $HOME/.cargo/env
       ```
3. Add WebAssembly target
    ```
    rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
    ```
4. Install simulator
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/radixdlt/radixdlt-scrypto.git
    cd radixdlt-scrypto
    cargo install --path ./simulator
    ```
5. (Optional) Open Scrypto documentation for later use
    ```
    ./doc.sh
    ```

## Getting Started

If you want a quick walkthrough of how to deploy and run some code, please see the [Run Your First Project](https://docs.radixdlt.com/main/scrypto/getting-started/run-first-project.html) tutorial. If you prefer to soldier through on your own, keep reading below.

### Writing Scrypto Code

1. Start by creating a new package:
```
scrypto new-package <package_name>
cd <package_name>
```
2. Check out the files under your current directory:
  - Source code is within `src/lib.rs`;
  - Test code is within `tests/lib.rs`.
3. Build your package:
```
scrypto build
```
4. Run tests:
```
scrypto test
```
