[workspace]
# NOTES:
# This workspace is intended to be used for the primary scrypto/radix engine library crates.
#
# In particular:
# * We purposefully don't include simulator - as it's an application, not a library
#   The simulator receives its own separate Cargo.lock, that we source control.
#   We don't source control the Cargo.lock for this workspace, because it's a workspace of libraries:
#   https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/faq.html#why-do-binaries-have-cargolock-in-version-control-but-not-libraries
#
# * We don't include any Scrypto packages here - they should be loaded/built separately, as they need separate profiles.
#   They either include their own shared workspace for a set of tests, or a [workspace] in each of their Cargo.tomls
#   to avoid falling back to the root workspace.
