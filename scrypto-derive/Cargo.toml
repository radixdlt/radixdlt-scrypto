[features]
# Currenlty, dependencies of procedrual macros are imported to host crates. This may accidentally 
# enable unwanted features of host dependencies, i.e. `serde`, `serde_json`, `sbor` and `scrypto-abi`.
# 
# To work around with it, we've added features `std` and `alloc` for `scrypto-derive`, even
# though it only works under `std` environment.
#
# See:
# - https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/5730
# - https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/7915
