# CARGO.LOCK - Source controlling strategy
#
# We have multiple workspaces/crates in this repository, with different Cargo.lock strategies.
#
# First off - let's blanket ignore all Cargo.lock files, so any old/historic ones stay ignored,
# to try to limit the amount of git breakage which will occur when we start to source control
# these
!Cargo.lock

# TYPE 1:
# - The root workspace of libraries.
#   As of August 2024, and a change in the Rust guidance around lock files for libraries
#   (see https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/08/29/committing-lockfiles.html), we now source control our
#   Cargo.lock file.
#   This allows our builds to be more reducible, and is a partial mitigation against supply chain attacks.
#   However, this is possibly at the expense of Scrypto users who will have their own Cargo.locks.
#   So we may wish to add a CI job to build against the latest versions, as per:
#   https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/guide/continuous-integration.html#verifying-latest-dependencies
!/Cargo.lock

# TYPE 3:
# - Examples should have their own Cargo.lock files to show good practice
!examples/**/Cargo.lock

# TYPE 4:
# - The asset scrypto packages. These need to be built deterministically, so include a Cargo.lock (at a shared workspace layer)
!radix-engine/assets/blueprints/Cargo.lock
!radix-transaction-scenarios/assets/blueprints/Cargo.lock

# TYPE 5:
# - Various test scrypto packages. We don't care too much about either way - but we do want CI to run without a lock, so let's git ignore these.
#   Also make sure to blanket ignore all the old Cargo.locks before they moved to blueprints, to avoid developer git issues
!scrypto-test/assets/blueprints/Cargo.lock
!scrypto-test/tests/blueprints/Cargo.lock
!radix-engine-tests/assets/blueprints/Cargo.lock
!radix-clis/tests/blueprints/Cargo.lock

# FURTHER DETAILS:
# Our CI tests ensure that libraries can build and have their tests run with an empty lock file (ie, with the latest semver
# crates available on crates.io).
#
# In the future, we leave the option open to including more Cargo.locks for more of the repository, to speed up our local
# builds and provide a consistent set of dependencies developers can use to get-up-and-running.
