========= SUMMARY HASHES =========
These Dugong hashes are permitted to change only until the protocol update is deployed to a permanent network, else it can cause divergence.
State changes: 95b66449fe6829bb (allowed to change if not deployed to any network)
Events       : 07c81f1e6d320830 (allowed to change if not deployed to any network)

==== POST ENACTMENT SCENARIOS ====
The following scenarios are set by default to run on testnets after this protocol update.
If there are any changes to this list after deploying a testnet, the testnet's ledger will need to be wiped (*not allowed on stokenet*) or the network's protocol update configuration will need to be customised in the node to override the scenarios run on it.
